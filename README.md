# FedoraConfigs
I created this to automate the post install setup on Fedora spins cinnamon. This only sets up things the way I like. Feel free to fork and change things to your liking. I am working on a more feature rich post install script that will work on many more distros and have selectable options with a GUI.

<br>
This will run on other desktop environments and distros but is only tested on [Fedora Spins Cinnamon](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/cinnamon/download)
